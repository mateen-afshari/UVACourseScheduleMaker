UVA Schedule Builder Website

## Description

The Course Builder Website is a collaborative project developed by a team to provide users with the ability to build schedules and share them with friends. This implementation aims to enhance the user experience compared to the retired Louslist website previously used by UVA students.

## Features

- Browsing Courses: The web application allows users to browse courses available in the UVA course catalog. Users can explore course details, such as descriptions, schedules, and instructors.
